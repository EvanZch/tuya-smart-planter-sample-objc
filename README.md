# TuyaSmartPlanter-ObjC
This sample demonstrates the use of Tuya iOS HomeSDK to build an IoT app from scratch. Tuya iOS HomeSDK is divided into several function groups to give developers a clear insight into the implementation for different features, including the user registration process, home management for different users, device network configuration, and controls. For device network configuration, the EZ mode and AP mode are implemented. This allows developers to pair devices over Wi-Fi and control the devices over LAN and MQTT. For device control, a common panel is used to send and receive any type of data points.
